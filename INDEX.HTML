Option 1: Art Gallery Website using Chicago Art Institute API
API Documentation Overview:

The Chicago Art Institute API provides data about artworks, but the images of the artworks are not directly included in the JSON responses. You'll need to save the images locally in your application and use the API to get metadata about the paintings.
Steps to Implement:

Set Up Your Project Structure:

Create a folder structure for your web project.
Set up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your website.
Fetch Data from the API:

Use JavaScript to fetch data from the Chicago Art Institute API.
The API will provide information like title, artist, description, and other metadata about artworks.
Display Artworks:

Create a grid or carousel to display the artworks.
Use the fetched data to populate the UI with images of the artworks. You'll need to save these images locally in your project folder.
Interactive Features (Bonus Points):

Implement a feature where clicking on an artwork displays a pop-up or modal window.
Populate this pop-up/modal with detailed information fetched from the API (e.g., artist name, description, year created).
Styling and UX:

Use CSS for styling to create an aesthetic and user-friendly art gallery interface.
Ensure the website is responsive and works well across different devices.
Option 2: Cryptocurrency Price Website using CoinLayer API
API Documentation Overview:

CoinLayer API provides real-time cryptocurrency prices and other related data.
Steps to Implement:

Project Setup:

Similar to Option 1, set up your project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
Fetch Data from the API:

Use JavaScript to fetch cryptocurrency data from the CoinLayer API.
You can fetch prices of specific cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.
Display Prices:

Design a clean and organized layout to display the fetched cryptocurrency prices.
Show prices in a tabular format or as cards for each cryptocurrency.
Update Frequency:

Implement auto-refresh functionality to periodically update the prices (optional).
Styling and UX:

Apply CSS to style the website and ensure it provides a clear and useful presentation of cryptocurrency prices.
Consider using color coding or other visual cues to highlight changes in prices (e.g., increase, decrease).
General Considerations:
API Authentication: Check if the APIs require any authentication (API keys, tokens) and handle it securely in your application.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for API requests to manage cases where data may not be available or requests fail.
